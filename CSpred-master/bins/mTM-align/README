 How to install mTM-align
=========================
To compile the program in your Linux computer, simply enter
make

or
g++  -O3 -ffast-math -static -lm -o mTM-align main.cpp TMM.cpp UPGMA.cpp

=====================
 How to use TM-align
=====================
USAGE: ./mTM-align -i <input_list> [Options]
 Options:
   -i input_list   The input_list is an input file, listing the file names of the structures to be aligned.
                   Each line represents the file name for one structure.
                   Please note that each input structure should be a single-chain structure.

   -o filename     The name of the file to save the superimposed structures. The default is 'result.pdb'
                   When the number of input structures is >61, the superimposed structures will be separated by 'MODEL'
                   Otherwise, the structures are speparated using the chain IDs: A,B,C,...


  -v               Print the version of mTM-align
  -h               Print this help information
 Example usage:
 ./mTM-align -i input_list
 ./mTM-align -i input_list -o result.pdb


Output:
  result.fasta   	Multiple structure alignment in the fasta format.
  result.pdb     	Superimposed structures, which can be shown by RasMol, PyMOL, Chimera and other softare.
  cc.pdb		Superimposed structures in common core region, which can be shown by RasMol, PyMOL, Chimera and other software.
  pairwise_TMscore.txt  Pairwise TM-score of structures.
  pairwise_rmsd.txt     Pairwise RMSD of structures.
  infile		Distance matrix, which can be used to generate phylogenetic tree by PHYLIP package.
  *_pair.pdb		Pairwise superimposed structures.

============================================
 How to generate phylogenetic tree by PHYLIP
============================================
1.Download PHYLIP package from http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/executables.html and install it.

2.To construct the phylogenetic tree, simplely enter 
phylip neighbor

3.enter 'N' to choose UPGMA method, and then enter 'Y' to confirm.

4.The phologenetic tree is shown in the file "outfile".
