This project provides the code I have modified for my Master's thesis at IISc Bengaluru. This project was done under Prof Ashok Sekhar, Biology Department, IISc.

This project uses two different approaches to predict the protein structure given its NMR data. I give full credit to the original authors for their contributions. Their work has enabled me to modify and tweak the code to make it work for NMR data.
